Execution parameters :

client_performance & sender_performance
~500 000 packets transferred
~10 min execution time
no printing

Analysis :

Nota bene :
- discussed costs down below are in "cycle estimation"

global cost : 20M

line 1 : free - 5M (25%)

lines 2&3 :  int malloc and malloc - 7M (35%)

line 4 : create segment buffer - 2M (10%)

line 6 : listener - 1M (5%) self, 10M (50%) incl

lines 8&10 : unyte queue read & write (origin : parser & listener) - 4M (20%)

lines 9&12 : mutex (origin : parser & listener) - 1.2M (6%)

line 11 : deserialize uint32 (origin : parser) - 0.6M (3%)

line 20 : parser - 0.2M (1%) self, 9M (45%) incl

=> malloc and free cost (60%) scales with the number of packets
=> create segment buffer cost (10%) is initial and constant
=> listener and parser have other important costs

Conclusion :

Although it is not the only thing that should be looked into in the long run, memory allocation has an important cost and should be a priority.
